# Validations ✅

## Example Validation 📝

### Purpose 🎯

The `exampleValidation.js` file provides middleware to validate incoming request data using Joi. This ensures that the data adheres to the required format and standards before it is processed by your application's business logic.

### Example Usage 🚀

📦 **`exampleValidation.js`:**

- **`validateExample(req, res, next):`** Ensures that the `example` field in the request body is a non-empty string. If the validation fails, a 400 status code and an error message are returned.

**Usage Example:**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { validateExample } = require('./validations/exampleValidation');
const router = express.Router();

router.post('/example', validateExample, (req, res) => {
	// Controller logic to handle the validated request data
	res.status(201).json({ message: 'Example created successfully' });
});
```

### Customization 🎨

- **Schema Adjustments:** You can modify the Joi schema within validateExample to match your application's specific data validation requirements.

- **Error Handling:** Customize the error messages or extend the validation logic to include more complex data validation rules.

### Additional Files 📂

The validations folder can be expanded with additional validators, such as:

- **`userValidation.js:`** For validating user-related data like registration, login, or profile updates.

- **`productValidation.js:`** To ensure product data such as names, prices, and categories are valid before processing.

- **`orderValidation.js:`** For validating order details before saving or processing them in the system.

By adding these validators, you can maintain consistent and accurate data throughout your application. 🔍
