# Models 📋

## Model - Example Model Functions 🧠

### Purpose 🎯

This file contains functions for interacting with the example data. These functions simulate database operations for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions.

### Structure 🗂️

- **Each function** represents a basic operation for managing example records.
- **Functions within this file** are responsible for:
  - **Retrieving Data:** Fetching records from the data source.
  - **Creating Records:** Adding new records to the data source.
  - **Updating Records:** Modifying existing records in the data source.
  - **Deleting Records:** Removing records from the data source.

#### Example - `exampleModel.js` 📦

- **`getAllExamples:`** Retrieves all example records from the data source.

- **`getExampleById:`** Retrieves a specific example record by ID.

- **`createExample:`** Adds a new example record to the data source.

- **`updateExample:`** Updates an existing example record by ID.

- **`deleteExample:`** Removes an example record by ID.

### Usage 🚀

To use these model functions in your application, you can import and use them in your controllers:

```javascript
const exampleModel = require('./models/exampleModel');

// Example usage in a controller
const getAllExamples = (req, res) => {
	const examples = exampleModel.getAllExamples();
	res.status(200).json({
		success: true,
		data: examples,
	});
};
```

### Customization 🛠️

- **Replace Mock Data:** Replace the in-memory data simulation with actual database operations as needed.

- **Modify Functions:** Adjust the functions to fit your application’s specific requirements and data structure.
