## Using the Features 🔧

### Authentication 🔒

- The template includes basic authentication setup. You can find the authentication middleware in the `middleware` directory. Customize the authentication logic as needed.

### Database Integration 💾

- Sequelize ORM is used for database interactions. Define your models in the `models` directory and configure your database connection in the `config` directory.

### Validation ✔️

- Use the pre-built validation middleware in the `validators` directory to ensure consistent and secure data handling.

## Examples 📝

Here are some examples to help you use the template effectively:

- **Example 1**: Setting up a new route with validation and authentication.
- **Example 2**: Integrating a new database model and performing CRUD operations.
- **Example 3**: Configuring environment variables for different stages of development.
